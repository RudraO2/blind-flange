/**
 * Blind Flange base plugin, browser half.
 *
 * Written directly in the host loader's module format, so this package ships no
 * React and needs no bundler: `require` inside the factory resolves
 * `react/jsx-runtime` and every `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-*` package from the
 * host at load time.
 *
 * Deliberately not an ES module, despite `"type": "module"` in the manifest.
 * The host serves this file as a raw bundle to the browser's module loader and
 * never `import`s it, so it is written as the loader's own format — a top-level
 * `window.__ModuleLoader__.load(...)` call with a CommonJS-shaped factory. Only
 * `exports["./client"]` points here, and only the host reads that.
 *
 * Story 1.1 mounted the seam and took no slot. Story 1.5 is the first
 * occupant: the Blind Flange mark in `conversation.hero.brand.mark` and
 * `sidebar.brand.mark`, the two places the DeepSeek whale used to render (see
 * `apply` below for why both, not just the one AC1 names). What Story 1.1 did
 * do is check that the host supplied the React seam every later panel depends
 * on, so a broken seam is reported here, by package name, instead of
 * surfacing as an obscure failure inside the routing chip or the egress
 * monitor — kept as-is below.
 *
 * Story 1.4 takes this package's first slot: `conversation.hero.agentPreset`.
 * The host's own agent-preset roster always includes its four shipped presets
 * (`standard`/`code`/`minimal`/`cordis`) alongside ours — `dsh-agent-presets`
 * hard-codes its shipped root into every deployment's resolved config, so a
 * profile patch cannot remove them (verified against a running `dsh web`,
 * 28 Aug 2026: `agentPreset.list` names all four no matter what this profile's
 * `cordis.patch.yml` configures). This component is an indicator rather than a
 * wrapper around the host's own hero chip: it reads the same roster over the
 * same host RPCs and shows only the presets Blind Flange authored
 * (`trust: 'user'`), so "Standard mode" and its shipped siblings never appear
 * here even though the host still lists them elsewhere (Settings > Agent
 * presets, unavoidably, for the same reason).
 *
 * It shipped as a dropdown and was corrected to a read-only indicator on
 * 28 Aug 2026: SIH26117 requires the system to pick automatically, so a control
 * asking the operator to classify the task contradicts the entry's own claim.
 *
 * Story 3.2 takes one more seat: `conversation.session.header.utilities`, a
 * read-only pill naming the active model-plane provider. When `replay` is the
 * provider it says so in plain words and says the responses are authored, not
 * captured (ADR-0001 amendment, 28 Aug 2026). The provider name is read from
 * the host's `llm.providers` directory — the Blind Flange adapter registered
 * in the host half (`index.js`) surfaces there as `Blind Flange (<provider>)` —
 * so this indicator reports the configured provider rather than guessing it.
